    <H1>Howto compile and install ETSDK+</H1>
    <HR>
    <p>In this howto i am going to show you how to compile and install ETSDK+, the enhanced source codebase for Wolfenstein Enemy Territory (W:ET) based on the <a href="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/et/sdk/">original ETSDK version 2.6 for W:ET</a>.</p>

    <p>We are going to download necessary tools for each platform, use them to build the mod, navigate through the installation process after we compiled the binaries, and configure the source to work with different compile options. The presentation of all this will be covered for each supported platform and in order of: tools and preparation, compilation, installation, advanced build options.<BR></p>
    <p><I>Notes:</I></p>
    <UL>
    <I>- Platform support: Linux, Windows. (Mac is unsupported currently.)</I><BR><BR>
    <I>- There are always a wide variety of ways to do stuff in the computer world. This howto is no exception. Do adjustments wherever you want.</I><BR><BR>
    <I>- If you are a beginner i recommend you to go through each step 1 by 1. Worth checking out are install scripts (will be done in this howto, but you can pack your mod manually as well) and lateron the advanced build options. Especially the install scripts can save you a ton of time.</I><BR><BR>
    <I>- To avoid switching back and forth between descriptions, i will cover certain topics just in time. For example some tools will not be installed in the "Tools and Preparation" section, but are covered lateron.</I><BR><BR>

    <H2>Windows</H2>
    <p>In this section, compile and install instructions for Windows are given. Currently, the only supported way of compiling for Windows is with Visual Studio 2008. You can skip the one or other process, but recommended is that you do all of them, and in order. Skippable parts will be marked with <TT>(Optional)</TT>.</p>    
    <H3>Tools and Preparation</H3>
    <p>1. Download and install Visual Studio 2008 Express.</p>
    <UL>
    Get it by typing <TT>Visual Studio 2008 Express</TT> in a search machine. One of the Microsoft sites still hosts it. This project only supports the 2008 version of Visual Studio. <U>Other versions of Visual Studio are not supported.</U>
    </UL>
    <p>2. Download and install mysysgit - Git for Windows. <TT>(Optional)</TT></p>
    <UL>Get it on their Google Code page: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list?q=full+installer+official+git">mysysgit on Google Code</a>. At this time, i downloaded version 1.8.4. We are going to use Git to checkout our code. I installed it with option <TT>Use Git Bash only</TT>. I would recommend using it solely from command-line. To do that, just go to <TT>c:\installation_path\Git Bash</TT> and double click that shortcut to open Git Bash.
    </UL>
    <p>3. Download the source code for ETSDK+.</p>
    <UL>
    (If you did not follow step 2, you can download the source code manually from the github page.)
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Git Bash is used to download the source. Open Git Bash, navigate to your Desktop folder or to your preferred place where you want to have your download be placed. (If this is new to you, then here is an example of how i do this on my system: <CODE>cd /c/Users/acqu/Desktop/</CODE>. This brings me to my Desktop). Type: <CODE>git clone https://github.com/acqu/wet-sdk-plus.git sdk-plus</CODE>. This will place the source code directory in folder <TT>sdk-plus</TT>.
    </UL>    
    <H3>Compilation</H3>
    <p>1. Open the Visual Studio 2008 project file.</p>
    <UL>
    Go to <TT>path/to/src</TT> and open the file <TT>wolf.sln</TT>.
    </UL>
    <p>2. Compile your mod with <TT>Release</TT> or <TT>Debug</TT> settings.</p>
    <UL>
    In the Solution Explorer on the left you see 3 projects: <TT>cgame</TT>, <TT>game</TT> and <TT>ui</TT>. These can be built separately, or you can start building the whole project at once. To build the whole project right-click on <TT>Solution 'wolf' (3 projects)</TT> in the Solution Explorer, select <TT>Build Solution</TT>. This will compile your source with <TT>Debug</TT> configuration enabled. To build with release configuration just hover over <TT>Solution Configurations</TT> on the top/middle of your Visual Studio window, and there select <TT>Release</TT> instead of <TT>Debug</TT>. Then rebuild.
    </UL>    
    <p>3. Check your build directory for compiled binaries.</p>    
    <UL>
    Once you finished compiling and everything went successful, you can find your compiled binaries in directory <TT>src/build/</TT>. The binaries are named <TT>cgame_mp_x86.dll</TT>, <TT>qagame_mp_x86.dll</TT> and <TT>ui_mp_x86.dll</TT>. Note: the debug files, as well as the release files, will be copied in this directory, so previous .dll files will be overwritten whenever you make a new compile.
    </UL>    
    <H3>Installation</H3>
    <p>Two ways to install this mod are described here: manual installation or using install scripts.</p>
    <H4>Manual installation</H4>
    <p>If you do not want to use the install scripts you can manually install the mod.</p>
    <p>1. Prepare client and server files.</p>
    <UL>
    For the client: compress <TT>gfx, scripts, sound, cgame_mp_x86.dll, ui_mp_x86.dll</TT> to <TT>.zip</TT> and rename the <TT>.zip</TT> extension to <TT>.pk3</TT>. The server just needs one file: <TT>qagame_mp_x86.dll</TT>. However, you will need additional files when you compile with advanced build options (see the respective paragraph <TT>Advanced Build Options</TT>) below.
    </UL>
    <p>2. Copy your prepared files to ET installation path.</p>
    <UL>
    At height of ET.exe create a folder with name <TT>mymod</TT>. Copy all your prepared files from step 1. in this folder. Note that with this set up, your client and your server will use the same folders and directories. Recommended is that you use one installation for the client and one for the server. But for now, this may be enough.
    </UL>
    <H4>Using install scripts</H4>
    <p>The following will explain what we just did manually by using windows batch scripts in the build directory. Note that these install scripts are not intended to be used when you compiled for <TT>Debug</TT> (but you can edit them to make them compatible of course).
    <p>1. Install 7-zip and edit your system path.</p>
    <UL>
    The build directory is used to install the mod. We are going to need 7-zip to make use of the install scripts. Download and install 7-zip from the <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip website</a>. Make sure you edit the system path such that Windows can find 7-zip.exe when we execute one of the install scripts. <a href="https://www.google.de/search?q=edit+windows+system+path">google "edit windows system path"</a>.
    </UL>
    <p>2. Configure the install scripts.</p>
    <UL>
    We are going to use the install scripts in the <TT>build directory</TT> (<TT>install.bat</TT> and <TT>install-ext.bat</TT>). These compress and copy your compiled mod to your ET modfolder. We keep everything simple for now and assume you compiled your mod with no advanced build option and that you want to use <TT>install.bat</TT> to install your mod. Open <TT>install.bat</TT> with a text editor. At the beginning of this script you see: <CODE>set PATH_TO_WETEXE_1=C:\Users\Random\WETc</CODE> and <CODE>set MODNAME=mymod</CODE>. These two lines need to be edited before you can start using the script. Set variable <CODE>PATH_TO_WETEXE_1</CODE> to point to the path where your ET.exe is located (on my system this is: <CODE>C:\Users\acqu\WETc\</CODE>). Then set variable <CODE>MODNAME</CODE> to a preferred name (in this example we just keep it with <TT>mymod</TT>).
    </UL>
    <p>3. Create your destination mod directory in your ET installation path which resembles your script settings.</p>
    <UL>
    After you have edited and saved the script with the correct path create an empty folder inside your ET installation path with the same name as variable <CODE>MODNAME</CODE> in your script (on my end i just create a folder named <TT>mymod</TT> at <TT>C:\Users\acqu\WETc\</TT>).
    </UL>
    <p>4. Execute install script.</p>
    <UL>
    After you configured your install script and created the empty folder with the right name, you open your windows command-line (click <TT>Start</TT> in windows, type <TT>cmd.exe</TT> in your search bar, click the result to open the command-line). From command-line navigate with cd command to your build directory. There type <TT>install.bat</TT> to execute the install script. It should compress and copy your mod to your configured path and folder (assuming of course it can find the binaries and you have configured the script correctly; you should also watch the output of the script in case of some failures; also be aware of permissions in Windows).
    </UL>
    <H4>Load and test your mod</H4>
    <p>Start ET.exe with the option <CODE>+set fs_game mymod</CODE> (to do this create a shortcut of ET.exe, right-click on it, select properties, go to target and append <TT>+set fs_game mymod</TT>. On my system it looks like this: <TT>C:\Users\acqu\WETc\ET.exe +set fs_game mymod</TT>). In main menu click <TT>Host Game</TT> and start up a test server. To see if everything went ok, join a team, press <TT>T</TT> to open the chat window, type something, hit enter. The text you wrote will pop up and beside that text you should see a team flag (allies or axis). If you do not see a team flag, than your mod is still running etmain. In this case, recheck the instructions, and if nothing worked, you may want to seek help at the SD forums.</p>
    <H3>Advanced Build Options</H3>
    <p>The advanced build options are nothing about compiler optimizations or similar. They are advanced features you may want to include in your mod when basing it on this codebase. These features are not enabled by default. To enable them you need to configure your build environment. In this section i will explain how to do this.</p>
    <p>The following lists the currently supported features:</p>
    <UL type="square">
    <LI >Lua scripting support interfacing with the game library</LI>
    <LI>Xpsave support via sqlite interfacing with the game library</LI>
    <LI>Omni-Bot support interfacing with the game library</LI>
    <LI>Camtrace support interfacing with the client library</LI>
    </UL>
    <p>Note that by the time of this writing, Xpsave support and Camtrace support are still under construction and do not yet contain all the intended features. They are working however.</p>
    <H4>Lua Support</H4>
    <p>The ET:Lua interface allows for altering game logic and data during runtime by using Lua scripts. The interface was merged from etpub and was slightly modified afterwards to achieve 100% bi-directional compatibility with etpro:lua, but this goal is not yet achieved.</p>
    <p>The Lua support is set up with dynamic library linking Lua from within the game module. We are going to use precompiled binaries from LuaBinaries at SourceForge. We also need to configure Visual Studio Project Settings. Note that you may skip step 1 (Download precompiled libs and prepare directory structure) and proceed from step 2 (Configure your Visual Studio Project Settings).</p>

    <p>Camtrace3D is a computer program for Windows used for editing camera paths. These camera paths are then loaded by ET to be executed during replay. The result is a powerful movie editing suite for ET.</p>
    <p>Enabeling camtrace does not require any additional development files. We just need to enable the preprocessor definition <TT>CAMTRACE_SUPPORT</TT>.</p>

    <H2>Linux</H2>
    <p>In this section, compile and install instructions for Linux are given. You can skip the one or other process, but recommended is that you do all of them, and in order. Skippable parts will be marked with <TT>(Optional)</TT>. Note that specific console commands are given with the assumption that you run Linux - Ubuntu 12.04. These commands may be differ from system to system.</p>    
    <H3>Tools and Preparation</H3>
    <p>1. Download and install Cmake version 2.8.1 or higher.</p>
    <UL>
    <CODE>sudo apt-get install cmake</CODE>
    </UL>
    <p>2. Download and install Codeblocks. <TT>(Optional)</TT></p>
    <UL>
    <CODE>sudo apt-get install codeblocks</CODE>
    </UL>
    <p>3. Download and install gcc and g++ compilers.</p>
    <UL>
    Native ET code requires gcc. Compiling with Omni-Bot support requires g++.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <CODE>sudo apt-get install gcc; sudo apt-get install g++</CODE>
    </UL>
    <p>4. 64 bit System Requirements.</p>
    <UL>
    If you run a 64 bit system you need gcc-multilib and g++-multilib.
    <BR>
    <BR>
    <CODE>sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib; sudo apt-get install g++-multilib</CODE>
    </UL>
    <p>5. Download and install Git. <TT>(Optional)</TT></p>
    <UL>
    <CODE>sudo apt-get install git</CODE>
    </UL>
    <p>6. Download the source code for ETSDK+.</p>
    <UL>
    (If you did not follow step 5, you can download the source code manually from the github page.)
    <BR>
    <BR>
	<CODE>git clone https://github.com/acqu/wet-sdk-plus.git sdk-plus</CODE>
    </UL>
    <H3>Compilation</H3>
    <p>1. Configure Build Settings.</p>
    <UL>
    Open <TT>src/CMakeLists.txt</TT>. Search for the config section at the beginning of the file <TT># config start</TT>. Decide and make adjustments. The main thing you have to decide is including advanced features (see the respective paragraph <TT>Advanced Build Options</TT>). Close and save.
    </UL>
    <p>2. Compile.</p>
    <UL>
    Open a terminal. Navigate to <TT>src</TT>. Type: <CODE>mkdir cmake; cd cmake</CODE>. Now create build files using cmake. I give two examples of how to do this. Type <TT>cmake --help</TT> to get more options about what cmake can do.
        <UL type="Circle">
        <li>Using makefile-based build environment: <CODE>cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"; make</CODE>.</li>
        <li>Using Codeblocks build environment: <CODE>cmake .. -G "CodeBlocks - Unix Makefiles"</CODE>, then open the solution file created at <TT>src/cmake/</TT> and compile from inside Codebblocks IDE.</li>
        </UL>
    </UL>
    <p>3. Check your build directory for compiled binaries.</p>    
    <UL>
    Once you finished compiling and everything went successful, you can find your compiled binaries in directory <TT>src/build/</TT>. The binaries are named <TT>cgame.mp.i386.so</TT>, <TT>qagame.mp.i386.so</TT> and <TT>ui.mp.i386.so</TT>. Note: the debug files, as well as the release files, will be copied in this directory, so previous .so files will be overwritten whenever you make a new compile.
    </UL>    
    <H3>Installation</H3>
    <p>Two ways to install this mod are described here: manual installation or using install scripts.</p>
    <H4>Manual installation</H4>
    <p>If you do not want to use the install scripts you can manually install the mod.</p>
    <p>1. Prepare client and server files.</p>
    <UL>
    For the client: compress <TT>gfx, scripts, sound, cgame.mp.i386.so, ui.mp.i386.so</TT> to <TT>.zip</TT> and rename the <TT>.zip</TT> extension to <TT>.pk3</TT>. The server just needs one file: <TT>qagame.mp.i386.so</TT>. However, you will need additional files when you compile with advanced build options (see the respective paragraph <TT>Advanced Build Options</TT>) below.
    </UL>
    <p>2. Copy your prepared files to ET homepath.</p>
    <UL>
    In your ET homepath create a folder with name <TT>mymod</TT> (the ET homepath can most likely be found at <TT>~/.etwolf</TT>). Copy all your prepared files from step 1. in this folder. Note that with this set up, your client and your server will use the same folders and directories. Recommended is that you use one installation for the client and one for the server. But for now, this may be enough.
    </UL>
    <H4>Using install scripts</H4>
    <p>The following will explain what we just did manually by using linux shell scripts in the build directory. Note that these install scripts are not intended to be used when you compiled for <TT>Debug</TT> (but you can edit them to make them compatible of course).
    <p>1. Configure the install scripts.</p>
    <UL>
    We are going to use the install scripts in the <TT>build directory</TT> (<TT>install.sh</TT> and <TT>install-ext.sh</TT>). These compress and copy your compiled mod to your ET modfolder located in ET homepath. We keep everything simple for now and assume you want to use <TT>install.sh</TT> to install your mod. Open <TT>install.sh</TT> with a text editor. At the beginning of this script you see: <CODE>ET_HOMEPATH='/home/random/.etwolf/'</CODE> and <CODE>MODNAME='mymod'</CODE>. These two lines need to be edited before you can start using the script. Set variable <CODE>ET_HOMEPATH</CODE> to point to your homepath (on my system this is: <CODE>/home/acqu/.etwolf/</CODE>). Then set variable <CODE>MODNAME</CODE> to a preferred name (in this example we just keep it with <TT>mymod</TT>).
    </UL>
    <p>3. Create your destination mod directory in your ET installation path which resembles your script settings.</p>
    <UL>
    After you have edited and saved the script with the correct path create an empty folder inside your ET homepath with the same name as variable <CODE>MODNAME</CODE> in your script (on my end i just create a folder named <TT>mymod</TT> at <TT>/home/acqu/.etwolf/</TT>).
    </UL>
    <p>4. Execute install script.</p>
    <UL>
    After you configured your install script and created the empty folder with the right name, you just execute the install script by opening a terminal, navigating to the build directory and typing <TT>sh install.sh</TT> (in this example). It should compress and copy your mod to your configured path and folder (assuming of course it can find the binaries and you have configured the script correctly; you should also watch the output of the script in case of some failures).
    </UL>
    <H4>Load and test your mod.</H4>
    <p>Start et.x86 with options <CODE>+set fs_homepath /home/random/.etwolf +set fs_game mymod</CODE>. In main menu click <TT>Host Game</TT> and start up a test server. To see if everything went ok, join a team, press <TT>T</TT> to open the chat window, type something, hit enter. The text you wrote will pop up and beside that text you should see a team flag (allies or axis). If you do not see a team flag, than your mod is still running etmain. In this case, recheck the instructions, and if nothing worked, you may want to seek help at the SD forums.</p>

    <H3>Advanced Build Options</H3>
    <p>The advanced build options are nothing about compiler optimizations or similar. They are advanced features you may want to include in your mod when basing it on this codebase. These features are not enabled by default. To enable them you need to configure your build environment. In this section i will explain how to do this.</p>
    <p>The following lists the currently supported features:</p>
    <UL type="square">
    <LI >Lua scripting support interfacing with the game library</LI>
    <LI>Xpsave support via sqlite interfacing with the game library</LI>
    <LI>Omni-Bot support interfacing with the game library</LI>
    <LI>Camtrace support interfacing with the client library</LI>
    </UL>
    <p>Note that by the time of this writing, Xpsave support and Camtrace support are still under construction and do not yet contain all the intended features. They are working however.</p>
    <H4>Lua Support</H4>
    <p>The ET:Lua interface allows for altering game logic and data during runtime by using Lua scripts. The interface was merged from etpub and was slightly modified afterwards to achieve 100% bi-directional compatibility with etpro:lua, but this goal is not yet achieved.</p>
    <p>The Lua support is set up with dynamic library linking Lua from within the game module. We are going to use precompiled binaries supplied with each distribution of Linux. We will need the library and include files, and configure <TT>CMakeLists.txt</TT>. Note that you may skip step 1 (Download and install library and include files.) and proceed from step 2 (Configure CMakeLists.txt).</p>
